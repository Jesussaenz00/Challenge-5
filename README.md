Challenge-5

In this project I was asked to review the data from a company that analyzes a specific form of skin cancer in mice. The company specialices in anti-cancer medications, and the data I analyzed was about the treatment that the mice received and what were the results after. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

With my research I found that:
  Capomulin is not the drug with the best mean outcome from them all, ramicane represents the best data in terms of mean tumor   volume. This meaning that capomulin did not performe as aspected, nevertheless, with a difference of .45 it places capomulin in the second place of mean tumor volume. It is also important to mention that the time frames inspected in the study did vary, but capomulin and ramicane were the top most evaluated time frames, meaning that the sample size are almost the same, enhancing their outcome in the study.

  Capomulin demonstrate that has success in reducing the tumor volume within 20 days of applicance. After 20 days of treatment the tumor decreased in volume to a point below the first day in treatment. 

  With the final correlation coefficient we can see that the tumor volume almost corresponds to the weight of the mice. Only one out of the twenty mice that were on capomulin treatment corresponded acordingly with its weight and the tumor volume, then we have a total of twelve mice with a tumor volume above the average according with their weight.
